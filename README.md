# Project Overview

## Earthquake Analysis Application
Deployed URL [Goes Here]

## Project Description
User will be able to search earthquake data from across the world for the past day.  User will be able to look up datatypes such as magnitude, location, time and if a tsunami was associated with it.

## API and Data Sample
I am using the USGS Earthquake API.  
API Link: [USGS API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)

API Documentation Link: [Documentation](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

## MVP
1. Choose filtering by Location, Magnitude, Time or Tsunami from individual dropdown menus
2. Render data for each dropdown menu in the results list
3. Create button to refresh page
4. Add background image to the page

## PostMVP
1. Add second API showing image of country where earthquake took place
2. Render Earthquake API data onto a map
